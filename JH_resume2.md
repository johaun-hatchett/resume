## Education

Aug. 2021 -- present
:   **Rice University** (Houston, TX)

    Ph.D. in Applied Physics  
    Advisor: Gururaj V. Naik

Sep. 2017 -- June 2021
:   **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** (Cambridge, MA)

    B.S. in Physics  
    Minor in Energy Studies, Concentration in Economics

## Research

### **Summer Intern --- MIT Lincoln Laboratory** (Lexington, MA)

May 2022 -- present
:   Project Title:

    Supervisor: *Annie Weathers, Ph.D.*

    1. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) energy system testbed

### **Undergraduate Research Assistant --- MIT** (Cambridge, MA)

Sep. 2020 -- June 2021
:   Project Title: *Nuclear Batteries -- a New Form of Clean and Resilient Energy for Remote Environments*

    Supervisor: *Ruaridh Macdonald, Ph.D.*

    1. Used the microgrid-simulating software GenX to optimize and analyze the potential economic and energy benefits due to the introduction of novel nuclear micro-reactor technologies in remote Alaskan communities. Additionally, added functionalities to the code (Julia language) to account for more complex phenomena (e.g. the variability of solar power over the course of the year).

June 2020 -- Dec. 2020
:   Project Title: *On the Feasibility of Gravitational Batteries for Grid-Scale Energy Storage*

    Supervisor: *Professor Robert L. Jaffe*

    1. Prepared a whitepaper, “Gravity Energy Storage,” to assist a study on the future of grid-scale energy storage conducted by the MIT Energy Initiative. The paper compiles and compares several commercial efforts to store electricity as gravitational potential energy according to their physical mechanisms, their associated economic costs, and their respective statuses of development.

Sep. 2019 -- June 2020
:   Project Title: *Spectroscopic Study of Accretion and Ejection From Supermassive Black Holes*

    Supervisor: *Professor Erin Kara*

    1. Analyzed data from XMM-Newton space telescope of X-ray emission of accretion disk of supermassive black hole 1H1934-063. Created and analyzed best-fit spectral models to determine the statistical significance of preliminary evidence for relativistic ejection event from black hole.
